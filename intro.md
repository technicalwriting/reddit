Welcome to r/technicalwriting! Please read through this thread before
asking career-related questions.

**Doing research is a huge part of being a technical writer. If it's too tedious
to read through all of this then you probably won't like technical writing.**

Also, just try searching the subreddit! It really works. E.g. if you're an
English major, searching for ``english major`` will return literally hundreds of
posts that are probably highly relevant to your situation.

If none of the posts are relevant to your situation, then you are welcome
to create a new post. Pro-tip: saying something like ``I reviewed the career FAQs``
will increase your chances of getting high-quality responses.
