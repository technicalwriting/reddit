Welcome to r/technicalwriting! **Please read through this thread before
asking career-related questions.** We have assembled FAQs for all stages of career
progression. Whether you're just starting out or have been a technical writer
for 20 years, your question has probably been answered many times already.

**Doing research is a huge part of being a technical writer (TW). If it's too tedious
to read through all of this then you probably won't like technical writing.**

Also, just try searching the subreddit! It really works. E.g. if you're an
English major, searching for ``english major`` will return literally hundreds of
posts that are probably highly relevant to you.

If none of the posts are relevant to your situation, then you are welcome
to create a new post. Pro-tip: saying something like ``I reviewed the career FAQs``
will increase your chances of getting high-quality responses from the r/technicalwriting
community.

Thank you for respecting our community's time and energy and best of luck on your career journey!

(A note on the organization: some posts are duplicated because they apply to multiple categories.
E.g. a post from a new grad double majoring in English and CS would show up under both the English
and CS sections.)
